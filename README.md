## Data Preprocessing (Steps 01 to 06):

- Utilize the pipeline provided by the MIMIC-Extract Pipeline.
- Follow the methodology outlined in the paper "Implementation for Improving Clinical Outcome Predictions Using Convolution over Medical Entities with Multimodal Learning" for data preparation.

## Model Training:

Execute the following Python scripts in sequence to train different models:
- LSTM_baseline.py: This script trains a baseline model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.
- Multimodal_baseline.py: This script is for training a baseline multimodal model
- Proposed_model.py: Run this script to train the proposed CNN model
